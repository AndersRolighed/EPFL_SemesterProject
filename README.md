# EPFL_SemesterProject
 Semester Project at EPFL for the spring semester of 2023.

DataCorruption is the file currently marking the scripts for corrupting the data using various methods. Currently working for the MNIST dataset.

FedAvg_Implementations has working Federated Averaging pipelines for both logistic regression and a simple neural network.

LogisticRegression-sklearn is just a simple implementation of Logistic Regression in sklearn (subject to be deleted).

In the data folder is the downloaded MNIST dataset.


The pipeline needs to be incorporated with the addition of the data corruption as well as they both need to allow for other data sets.
